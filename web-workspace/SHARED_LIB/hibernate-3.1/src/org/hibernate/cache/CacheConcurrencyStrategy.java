/**
 * Implementors manage transactional access to cached data. Transactions
 * pass in a timestamp indicating transaction start time. Two different
 * implementation patterns are provided for. A transaction-aware cache
 * implementation might be wrapped by a "synchronous" concurrency strategy, 
 * where updates to the cache are written to the cache inside the transaction. 
 * A non transaction-aware cache would be wrapped by an "asynchronous"
 * concurrency strategy, where items are merely "soft locked" during the 
 * transaction and then updated during the "after transaction completion"
 * phase. The soft lock is not an actual lock on the database row - 
 * only upon the cached representation of the item.<br>
 * <br>
 * For the client, update lifecycles are: lock->evict->release,
 * lock->update->afterUpdate, insert->afterInsert.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that, for an asynchronous cache, cache invalidation must be a two 
 * step process (lock->release, or lock-afterUpdate), since this is the only 
 * way to guarantee consistency with the database for a nontransaction cache 
 * implementation. For a synchronous cache, cache invalidation is a single 
 * step process (evict, or update). Hence, this interface defines a three
 * step process, to cater for both models.
