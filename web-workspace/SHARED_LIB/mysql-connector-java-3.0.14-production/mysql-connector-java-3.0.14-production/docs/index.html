          Interface/Class)</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>MySQL Connector/J passes all of the tests in Sun's JDBC
          compliance testsuite except for tests requiring stored procedures
          (which MySQL does not have at this time). However, in many places
          the JDBC specification is vague about how certain functionality
          should be implemented, or the specification allows leeway in
          implementation.</p><p>This section gives details on a interface-by-interface level
          about how certain implementation decisions may affect how you use
          MySQL Connector/J.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Blob</p><p>The Blob implementation does not allow in-place
              modification (they are 'copies', as reported by the
              DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because of
              this, you should use the corresponding
              PreparedStatement.setBlob() or ResultSet.updateBlob() (in the
              case of updatable result sets) methods to save changes back to
              the database.</p><p>Starting with Connector/J version 3.1.0, you can emulate
              Blobs with locators by adding the property
              'emulateLocators=true' to your JDBC URL. You must then
              use a column alias with the value of the column set to the
              actual name of the Blob column in the SELECT that you write to
              retrieve the Blob. The SELECT must also reference only one
              table, the table must have a primary key, and the SELECT must
              cover all columns that make up the primary key. The driver will
              then delay loading the actual Blob data until you retrieve the
              Blob and call retrieval methods (getInputStream(), getBytes(),
              etc) on it.</p></li><li><p>CallableStatement</p><p>Starting with Connector/J 3.1.1, stored procedures are
              supported when connecting to MySQL version 5.0 or newer via the
              <tt class="classname">CallableStatement</tt> interface. Currently,
              the <tt class="function">getParameterMetaData()</tt> method of
              <tt class="classname">CallableStatement</tt> is not supported.</p></li><li><p>Clob</p><p>The Clob implementation does not allow in-place
              modification (they are 'copies', as reported by the
              DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because of
              this, you should use the PreparedStatement.setClob() method to
              save changes back to the database. The JDBC API does not have a
              ResultSet.updateClob() method.</p></li><li><p>Connection</p><p>Unlike older versions of MM.MySQL the 'isClosed()'
              method does not "ping" the server to determine if it is
              alive. In accordance with the JDBC specification, it only
              returns true if 'closed()' has been called on the
              connection. If you need to determine if the connection is still
              valid, you should issue a simple query, such as "SELECT
              1". The driver will throw an exception if the connection is
              no longer valid.</p></li><li><p>DatabaseMetaData</p><p>Foreign Key information (getImported/ExportedKeys() and
              getCrossReference()) is only available from
              'InnoDB'-type tables. However, the driver uses 'SHOW
              CREATE TABLE' to retrieve this information, so when other
              table types support foreign keys, the driver will transparently
              support them as well.</p></li><li><p>Driver</p></li><li><p>PreparedStatement</p><p>PreparedStatements are implemented by the driver, as MySQL
              does not have a prepared statement feature. Because of this, the
              driver does not implement getParameterMetaData() or
              getMetaData() as it would require the driver to have a complete
              SQL parser in the client.</p><p>Starting with version 3.1.0 MySQL Connector/J, server-side
              prepared statements and 'binary-encoded' result sets are
              used when the server supports them.</p><p>Take care when using a server-side prepared statement with
              "large" parameters that are set via setBinaryStream(),
              setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(), setBlob(), or setClob().
              If you want to re-execute the statement with any "large"
              parameter changed to a non-"large" parameter, it is
              necessary to call clearParameters() and set all parameters
              again. The reason for this is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>The driver streams the 'large' data
                  'out-of-band' to the prepared statement on the
                  server side when the parameter is set (before execution of
                  the prepared statement).</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Once that has been done, the stream used to read the
                  data on the client side is closed (as per the JDBC spec),
                  and can't be read from again.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>If a parameter changes from "large" to
                  non-"large", the driver must reset the server-side
                  state of the prepared statement to allow the parameter that
                  is being changed to take the place of the prior
                  "large" value. This removes all of the
                  'large' data that has already been sent to the
                  server, thus requiring the data to be re-sent, via the
                  setBinaryStream(), setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(),
                  setBlob() or setClob() methods.</p></li></ul></div><p>Consequently, if you want to change the "type" of
              a parameter to a non-"large" one, you must call
              clearParameters() and set all parameters of the prepared
              statement again before it can be re-executed.</p></li><li><p>ResultSet</p><p>By default, ResultSets are completely retrieved and stored
              in memory. In most cases this is the most efficient way to
              operate, and due to the design of the MySQL network protocol is
              easier to implement. If you are working with ResultSets that
              have a large number of rows or large values, and can not
              allocate heap space in your JVM for the memory required, you can
              tell the driver to 'stream' the results back one row
              at-a-time.</p><p>To enable this functionality, you need to create a
              Statement instance in the following manner:
              <pre class="programlisting">
stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);</pre>The combination of a
              forward-only, read-only result set, with a fetch size of
              Integer.MIN_VALUE serves as a signal to the driver to
              "stream" result sets row-by-row. After this any result
              sets created with the statement will be retrieved row-by-row.</p><p>There are some caveats with this approach. You will have
              to read all of the rows in the result set (or close it) before
              you can issue any other queries on the connection, or an
              exception will be thrown. Also, any tables referenced by the
              query that created the streaming result will be locked until all
              of the results have been read or the connection closed.</p></li><li><p>ResultSetMetaData</p><p>The 'isAutoIncrement()' method only works when
              using MySQL servers 4.0 and newer.</p></li><li><p>Statement</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N4000BD"></a>1.2.1.2.&nbsp;Un-implemented Functionality</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>The following methods in the JDBC API have not been

        adding the FULL path to it to your CLASSPATH enviornment variable, or
        by copying the .jar file to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext. If you are going

        'org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver' class name is also usable to remain
        backwards-compatible with MM.MySQL. You should use this class name
        when registering the driver, or when otherwise configuring software to
        use MySQL Connector/J.</p><p>The JDBC URL format for MySQL Connector/J is as follows, with
        items in square brackets ([, ]) being optional:<pre class="screen">jdbc:mysql://[host][,failoverhost...][:port]/[database][?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&amp;propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...</pre></p><p>If the hostname is not specified, it defaults to
        '127.0.0.1'. If the port is not specified, it defaults to
        '3306', the default port number for MySQL servers.</p><p>Starting with version 3.0.12 and 3.1.2, Connector/J supports
        multiple hosts with ports, separated by commas:</p><pre class="screen">jdbc:mysql://[host:port],[host:port].../[database][?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&amp;propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...</pre><p>If the database is not specified, the connection will be made
        with no 'current' database. In this case, you will need to
        either call the 'setCatalog()' method on the Connection
        instance, issue a 'USE dbname' query or fully-specify table
        names using the database name (i.e. 'SELECT
        dbname.tablename.colname FROM dbname.tablename...') in your SQL.
        Not specifying the database to use upon connection is generally only
        useful when building tools that work with multiple databases, such as
        GUI database managers.</p><p>MySQL Connector/J has fail-over support. This allows the driver
        to fail-over to any number of "slave" hosts and still perform
        read-only queries. Fail-over only happens when the connection is in an
        autoCommit(true) state, because fail-over can not happen reliably when
        a transaction is in progress. Most good application servers and
        connection pools set autoCommit to 'true' at the end of every
        transaction/connection use. The fail-over functionality has the
        following behavior: If the URL property "autoReconnect" is
        false: Failover only happens at connection initialization, and
        failback occurs when the driver determines that the first host has
        become available again If the URL property "autoReconnect" is
        true: Failover happens when the driver determines that the connection
        has failed (before <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> query), and falls back
        to the first host when it determines that the host has become
        available again (after queriesBeforeRetryMaster queries have been
        issued). In either case, whenever you are connected to a
        "failed-over" server, the connection will be set to read-only
        state, so queries that would modify data will have exceptions thrown
        (the query will <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> be processed by the MySQL
        server).</p><p>You may specify additional properties to the JDBC driver, either
        by placing them in a java.util.Properties instance and passing that
        instance to the DriverManager when you connect, or by adding them to
        the end of your JDBC URL as name-value pairs. The first property needs
        to be preceeded with a '?' character, and additional
        name-value pair properties are separated by an '&amp;'
        character. The properties, their definitions and their default values
        are covered in the following table:</p><div class="table"><a name="N40014F"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;Connection Properties</b></p><table summary="Connection Properties" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Definition</th><th>Required?</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Since Version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>user</td><td>The user to connect as</td><td>No</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>All</td></tr><tr><td>password</td><td>The password to use when connecting</td><td>No</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>All</td></tr><tr><td>gatherPerfMetrics</td><td>Should the driver gather performance metrics, and

        don't use a 'namedPipePath' property, the default of
        '\\.\pipe\MySQL' will be used. If you use the
        NamedPipeSocketFactory, the hostname and port number values in the

        same physical machine as the one the JDBC driver is being used on. In
        simple performance tests, it appears that named pipe access is between
        30%-50% faster than the standard TCP/IP access.</p><p>You can create your own socket factories by following the

        the results through the ResultSet class which is described later. To
        get a Statement object, you call the createStatement() method on the
        Connection object you have retrieved via the
        DriverManager.getConnection() method. Once you have a Statement
        object, you can execute a SELECT query by calling the
        executeQuery(String SQL) method with the SQL you want to use. To
        update data in the database use the executeUpdate(String SQL) method.
        This method returns the number of rows affected by the update
        statement. If you don't know ahead of time whether the SQL
        statement will be a SELECT or an UPDATE/INSERT, then you can use the
        execute(String SQL) method. This method will return true if the SQL
        query was a SELECT, or false if an UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE query. If the
        query was a SELECT query, you can retrieve the results by calling the
        getResultSet() method. If the query was an UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE query,
        you can retrieve the affected rows count by calling getUpdateCount()
        on the Statement instance.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N400426"></a>3.1.4.&nbsp;Executing a SELECT Query</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p></p><div class="example"><a name="N40042A"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.3.&nbsp;Using java.sql.Statement to Execute a SELECT Query</b></p><p></p><pre class="programlisting">// assume conn is an already created JDBC connection

        query, and the amount of data it returns.</p><p>For SSL Support to work, you must have the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A JDK that includes JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension),
            like JDK-1.4.1 or newer. SSL does not currently work with a JDK

        into a Java truststore. A sample MySQL server CA Certificate is
        located in the 'SSL' subdirectory of the MySQL source
        distribution. This is what SSL will use to determine if you are
        communicating with a secure MySQL server.</p><p>To use Java's 'keytool' to create a truststore in
        the current directory , and import the server's CA certificate
        ('cacert.pem'), you can do the following (assuming
        that'keytool' is in your path. It's located in the

        MySQL server knows that it is talking to a secure client:</p><p><pre class="programlisting"> shell&gt; keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias mysqlClientCertificate -keystore keystore </pre></p><p>Keytool will prompt you for the following information, and

        have generated, you need to set the following system properties when
        you start your JVM, replacing 'path_to_keystore_file' with the
        full path to the keystore file you created,
        'path_to_truststore_file' with the path to the truststore file
        you created, and using the appropriate password values for each
        property.</p><p><pre class="programlisting">-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore_file

        your connection parameters for MySQL Connector/J, either by adding
        'useSSL=true' to your URL, or by setting the property
        'useSSL' to 'true' in the java.util.Properties
        instance you pass to DriverManager.getConnection().</p><p>You can test that SSL is working by turning on JSSE debugging

    address for our bugs database. This database is public, and can be browsed
    and searched by anyone. If you log in to the system, you will also be able
    to enter new reports.</p><p>If you have found a sensitive security bug in MySQL, you can send
    email to <a href="mailto:security@mysql.com" target="_top">security@mysql.com</a>
    Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first
    time saves time both for us and for yourself. A good bug report,
    containing a full test case for the bug, makes it very likely that we will
    fix the bug in the next release. This section will help you write your
    report correctly so that you don't waste your time doing things that
    may not help us much or at all.</p><p>If you have a repeatable bug report, please report it to the bugs
    database at <a href="???" target="_top">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>. Any bug that
    we are able to repeat has a high chance of being fixed in the next MySQL
    release. To report other problems, you can use one of the MySQL mailing
    lists. Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a message
    containing too much information, but not to one containing too little.
    People often omit facts because they think they know the cause of a
    problem and assume that some details don't matter. A good principle is
    this: If you are in doubt about stating something, state it. It is faster
    and less troublesome to write a couple more lines in your report than to
    wait longer for the answer if we must ask you to provide information that
    was missing from the initial report. The most common errors made in bug
    reports are (a) not including the version number of Connector/J or MySQL
    used, and (b) not fully describing the platform on which Connector/J is
    installed (including the JVM version, and the platform type and version
    number that MySQL itself is installed on). This is highly relevant
    information, and in 99 cases out of 100, the bug report is useless without
    it. Very often we get questions like, ``Why doesn't this work for
    me?'' Then we find that the feature requested wasn't
    implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug described in a report has
    already been fixed in newer MySQL versions. Sometimes the error is
    platform-dependent; in such cases, it is next to impossible for us to fix
    anything without knowing the operating system and the version number of
    the platform.</p><p>If at all possible, you should create a repeatable, stanalone
    testcase that doesn't involve any third-party classes.</p><p>To streamline this process, we ship a base class for testcases with
    Connector/J, named '<tt class="classname">com.mysql.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport</tt>'.
    To create a testcase for Connector/J using this class, create your own
    class that inherits from <tt class="classname">com.mysql.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport</tt>
    and override the methods <tt class="methodname">setUp()</tt>,
    <tt class="methodname">tearDown()</tt> and <tt class="methodname">runTest</tt>().</p><p>In the <tt class="methodname">setUp()</tt> method, create code that
    creates your tables, and populates them with any data needed to
    demonstrate the bug.</p><p>In the <tt class="methodname">runTest</tt>() method, create code that
    demonstrates the bug using the tables and data you created in the
    'setUp' method.</p><p>In the <tt class="methodname">tearDown()</tt> method, drop any tables
    you created in the <tt class="methodname">setUp()</tt> method.</p><p>In any of the above three methods, you should use one of the
    variants of the <tt class="methodname">getConnection</tt>() method to create
    a JDBC connection to MySQL:</p><p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>getConnection() - Provides a
    connection to the JDBC URL specified in getUrl(). If a connection already
    exists, that connection is returned, otherwise a new connection is
    created.</p></li><li><p>getNewConnection() - Use this if
    you need to get a new connection for your bug report (i.e. there's
    more than one connection involved).</p></li><li><p>getConnection(String
    url) - Returns a connection using the given URL.</p></li><li><p>getConnection(String
    url, Properties props) - Returns a connection using the given URL and
    properties.</p></li></ul></div>If you need to use a JDBC URL
    that is different than 'jdbc:mysql:///test', then override the
    method <tt class="methodname">getUrl()</tt> as well.</p><p>Use the <tt class="methodname">assertTrue(boolean expression)</tt> and
    <tt class="methodname">assertTrue(String failureMessage, boolean expression)</tt>
    methods to create conditions that must be met in your testcase
    demonstrating the behavior you are expecting (vs. the behavior you are
    observing, which is why you are most likely filing a bug report).</p><p>Finally, create a <tt class="methodname">main</tt>() method that
    creates a new instance of your testcase, and calls the
    <tt class="methodname">run</tt> method: <pre class="programlisting">public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      new MyBugReport().run();
 }</pre> Once you have finished your testcase, and have verified
    that it demonstrates the bug you are reporting, upload it with your bug
    report to <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/" target="_top">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N400694"></a>Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>There are a few issues that seem to be commonly encountered often by

          Connector/J connects to MySQL, the security manager in MySQL server
          will use its grant tables to determine whether or not the connection
          should be allowed.</p><p>You must add grants to allow this to happen. The following is
          an example of how to do this (but not the most secure).</p><p>From the mysql command-line client, logged in as a user that

          use. Be aware that RedHat Linux is broken with respect to the
          hostname portion for the case when you are connecting from
          localhost. You need to use "localhost.localdomain" for the
          [hostname] value in this case. Follow this by issuing the "FLUSH

          been installed with the "--skip-networking" option set, or
          your MySQL server has a firewall sitting in front of it.</p><p>Applets can only make network connections back to the machine
          that runs the web server that served the .class files for the
          applet. This means that MySQL must run on the same machine (or you
          must have some sort of port re-direction) for this to work. This
          also means that you will not be able to test applets from your local
          file system, you must always deploy them to a web server.</p><p>MySQL Connector/J can only communicate with MySQL using
          TCP/IP, as Java does not support Unix domain sockets. TCP/IP
          communication with MySQL might be affected if MySQL was started with
          the "--skip-networking" flag, or if it is firewalled.</p><p>If MySQL has been started with the "--skip-networking"
          option set (the Debian Linux package of MySQL server does this for
          example), you need to comment it out in the file /etc/mysql/my.cnf
          or /etc/my.cnf. Of course your my.cnf file might also exist in the
          "data" directory of your MySQL server, or anywhere else
          (depending on how MySQL was compiled for your system). Binaries
          created by MySQL AB always look in /etc/my.cnf and [datadir]/my.cnf.
          If your MySQL server has been firewalled, you will need to have the
          firewall configured to allow TCP/IP connections from the host where
          your Java code is running to the MySQL server on the port that MySQL
          is listening to (by default, 3306).</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td valign="top" align="left"><a name="N4006D2"></a><a name="N4006D3"></a><b>5.4. </b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>I have a servlet/application that works fine for a day, and

          either need to use a connection pool that handles stale connections
          or use the "autoReconnect" parameter (see "Developing
          Applications with MySQL Connector/J").</p><p>Also, you should be catching SQLExceptions in your application
          and dealing with them, rather than propagating them all the way
          until your application exits, this is just good programming
          practice. MySQL Connector/J will set the SQLState (see
          java.sql.SQLException.getSQLState() in your APIDOCS) to
          "08S01" when it encounters network-connectivity issues
          during the processing of a query. Your application code should then
          attempt to re-connect to MySQL at this point.</p><p>The following (simplistic) example shows what code that can

# $Id: CHANGES,v 1.38.4.62 2004/02/11 02:15:16 mmatthew Exp $

xx-xx-04 - Version 3.1.2-alpha (not yet released)

    - Fixed stored procedure parameter parsing info when size was
      specified for a parameter (i.e. char(), varchar()).
  
    - Enabled callable statement caching via 'cacheCallableStmts'
      property.
  
    - Fixed case when no output parameters specified for a 
      stored procedure caused a bogus query to be issued 
      to retrieve out parameters, leading to a syntax error
      from the server.
  
    - Fixed case when no parameters could cause a NullPointerException
      in CallableStatement.setOutputParameters().

    - Removed wrapping of exceptions in MysqlIO.changeUser().

    - Fixed sending of split packets for large queries, enabled nio
      ability to send large packets as well.
  
    - Added .toString() functionality to ServerPreparedStatement,
      which should help if you're trying to debug a query that is
      a prepared statement (it shows SQL as the server would process).
  
    - Added 'gatherPerformanceMetrics' property, along with properties
      to control when/where this info gets logged (see docs for more 
      info).
 
    - ServerPreparedStatements weren't actually de-allocating
      server-side resources when .close() was called.

02-14-04 - Version 3.1.1-alpha

    - Fixed bug with UpdatableResultSets not using client-side
      prepared statements.
  
    - Fixed character encoding issues when converting bytes to
      ASCII when MySQL doesn't provide the character set, and
      the JVM is set to a multibyte encoding (usually affecting
      retrieval of numeric values).

    - Unpack 'unknown' data types from server prepared statements
      as Strings.
  
    - Implemented long data (Blobs, Clobs, InputStreams, Readers)
      for server prepared statements.
  
    - Implemented Statement.getWarnings() for MySQL-4.1 and newer
      (using 'SHOW WARNINGS').

    - Default result set type changed to TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
      (JDBC compliance).
  
    - Centralized setting of result set type and concurrency.

    - Re-factored how connection properties are set and exposed
      as DriverPropertyInfo as well as Connection and DataSource
      properties.
  
    - Support for NIO. Use 'useNIO=true' on platforms that support
      NIO.
 
    - Support for SAVEPOINTs (MySQL &gt;= 4.0.14 or 4.1.1).

    - Support for mysql_change_user()...See the changeUser() method
      in com.mysql.jdbc.Connection.
  
    - Reduced number of methods called in average query to be more
      efficient.
 
    - Prepared Statements will be re-prepared on auto-reconnect. Any errors
      encountered are postponed until first attempt to re-execute the
      re-prepared statement.
  
    - Ensure that warnings are cleared before executing queries
      on prepared statements, as-per JDBC spec (now that we support
      warnings).
 
    - Support 'old' profileSql capitalization in ConnectionProperties.
      This property is deprecated, you should use 'profileSQL' if possible.
  
    - Optimized Buffer.readLenByteArray() to return shared empty byte array 
      when length is 0.
 
    - Allow contents of PreparedStatement.setBlob() to be retained
      between calls to .execute*().
  
    - Deal with 0-length tokens in EscapeProcessor (caused by callable
      statement escape syntax).
  
    - Check for closed connection on delete/update/insert row operations in 
      UpdatableResultSet. 

    - Fix support for table aliases when checking for all primary keys in 
      UpdatableResultSet.
    
    - Removed useFastDates connection property. 
    
    - Correctly initialize datasource properties from JNDI Refs, including 
      explicitly specified URLs.
  
    - DatabaseMetaData now reports supportsStoredProcedures() for 
      MySQL versions &gt;= 5.0.0
  
    - Fixed stack overflow in Connection.prepareCall() (bad merge).

    - Fixed IllegalAccessError to Calendar.getTimeInMillis() in DateTimeValue
      (for JDK &lt; 1.4). 
  
    - Fix for BUG#1673, where DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() is not
      returning correct column ordinal info for non '%' column name patterns.
      
    - Merged fix of datatype mapping from MySQL type 'FLOAT' to 
      java.sql.Types.REAL from 3.0 branch.
      
    - Detect collation of column for RSMD.isCaseSensitive().
    
    - Fixed sending of queries &gt; 16M.
    
    - Added named and indexed input/output parameter support to CallableStatement.
      MySQL-5.0.x or newer.
      
    - Fixed NullPointerException in ServerPreparedStatement.setTimestamp(),
      as well as year and month descrepencies in 
      ServerPreparedStatement.setTimestamp(), setDate().
      
    - Added ability to have multiple database/JVM targets for compliance
      and regression/unit tests in build.xml.
      
    - Fixed NPE and year/month bad conversions when accessing some 
      datetime functionality in ServerPreparedStatements and their 
      resultant result sets.
      
    - Display where/why a connection was implicitly closed (to
      aid debugging).
      
    - CommunicationsException implemented, that tries to determine
      why communications was lost with a server, and displays
      possible reasons when .getMessage() is called.
      
    - Fixed BUG#2359, NULL values for numeric types in binary
      encoded result sets causing NullPointerExceptions.
      
    - Implemented Connection.prepareCall(), and DatabaseMetaData.
      getProcedures() and getProcedureColumns().
      
    - Reset 'long binary' parameters in ServerPreparedStatement when
      clearParameters() is called, by sending COM_RESET_STMT to the 
      server.
      
    - Merged prepared statement caching, and .getMetaData() support
      from 3.0 branch.
    
    - Fixed off-by-1900 error in some cases for 
      years in TimeUtil.fastDate/TimeCreate() when unpacking results
      from server-side prepared statements.
      
    - Fixed BUG#2502 -- charset conversion issue in getTables().
    
    - Implemented multiple result sets returned from a statement 
      or stored procedure.
      
    - Fixed BUG#2606 -- Server side prepared statements not returning
      datatype 'YEAR' correctly.
      
    - Enabled streaming of result sets from server-side prepared
      statements.
      
    - Fixed BUG#2623 -- Class-cast exception when using 
      scrolling result sets and server-side prepared statements.
  
    - Merged unbuffered input code from 3.0.

    - Fixed ConnectionProperties that weren't properly exposed
      via accessors, cleaned up ConnectionProperties code.
  
    - Fixed BUG#2671, NULL fields not being encoded correctly in
      all cases in server side prepared statements.
  
    - Fixed rare buffer underflow when writing numbers into buffers
      for sending prepared statement execution requests.
  
02-18-03 - Version 3.1.0-alpha

    - Added 'requireSSL' property.
    
    - Added 'useServerPrepStmts' property (default 'false'). The
      driver will use server-side prepared statements when the
      server version supports them (4.1 and newer) when this
      property is set to 'true'. It is currently set to 'false' 
      by default until all bind/fetch functionality has been 
      implemented. Currently only DML prepared statements are
      implemented for 4.1 server-side prepared statements.
  
    - Track open Statements, close all when Connection.close()
      is called (JDBC compliance).

05-27-04 - Version 3.0.14-production
    - Fixed BUG#3923 - URL parsing error

05-27-04 - Version 3.0.13-production

      1 result for batched insertions

05-18-04 - Version 3.0.12-production
    - Add unsigned attribute to DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() output
      in the TYPE_NAME column.

    - Added 'failOverReadOnly' property, to allow end-user to configure
      state of connection (read-only/writable) when failed over.

    - Backported 'change user' and 'reset server state' functionality
      from 3.1 branch, to allow clients of MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource
      to reset server state on getConnection() on a pooled connection.

    - Don't escape SJIS/GBK/BIG5 when using MySQL-4.1 or newer.

    - Allow 'url' parameter for MysqlDataSource and MysqlConnectionPool
      DataSource so that passing of other properties is possible from
      inside appservers.

    - Map duplicate key and foreign key errors to SQLState of
      '23000'.

    - Backport documentation tooling from 3.1 branch.

    - Return creating statement for ResultSets created by
      getGeneratedKeys() (BUG#2957)

    - Allow java.util.Date to be sent in as parameter to
      PreparedStatement.setObject(), converting it to a Timestamp
      to maintain full precision (BUG#3103).

    - Don't truncate BLOBs/CLOBs when using setBytes() and/or
      setBinary/CharacterStream() (BUG#2670).

    - Dynamically configure character set mappings for field-level
      character sets on MySQL-4.1.0 and newer using 'SHOW COLLATION'
      when connecting.

    - Map 'binary' character set to 'US-ASCII' to support DATETIME
      charset recognition for servers &gt;= 4.1.2

    - Use 'SET character_set_results" during initialization to allow any 
      charset to be returned to the driver for result sets.

    - Use charsetnr returned during connect to encode queries before
      issuing 'SET NAMES' on MySQL &gt;= 4.1.0.

    - Add helper methods to ResultSetMetaData (getColumnCharacterEncoding()
      and getColumnCharacterSet()) to allow end-users to see what charset
      the driver thinks it should be using for the column.

    - Only set character_set_results for MySQL &gt;= 4.1.0.

    - Fixed BUG#3511, StringUtils.escapeSJISByteStream() not covering all
      eastern double-byte charsets correctly.

    - Renamed StringUtils.escapeSJISByteStream() to more appropriate
      escapeEasternUnicodeByteStream().

    - Fixed BUG#3554 - Not specifying database in URL caused MalformedURL
      exception.

    - Auto-convert MySQL encoding names to Java encoding names if used
      for characterEncoding property.

    - Added encoding names that are recognized on some JVMs to fix case
      where they were reverse-mapped to MySQL encoding names incorrectly.

    - Use junit.textui.TestRunner for all unit tests (to allow them to be
      run from the command line outside of Ant or Eclipse).

    - Fixed BUG#3557 - UpdatableResultSet not picking up default values
      for moveToInsertRow().

    - Fixed BUG#3570 - inconsistent reporting of column type. The server
      still doesn't return all types for *BLOBs *TEXT correctly, so the
      driver won't return those correctly.

    - Fixed BUG#3520 -- DBMD.getSQLStateType() returns incorrect value.

    - Fixed regression in PreparedStatement.setString() and eastern character
      encodings.

    - Made StringRegressionTest 4.1-unicode aware.

02-19-04 - Version 3.0.11-stable

    - Trigger a 'SET NAMES utf8' when encoding is forced to 'utf8' _or_
    'utf-8' via the 'characterEncoding' property. Previously, only the
    Java-style encoding name of 'utf-8' would trigger this.

    - AutoReconnect time was growing faster than exponentially (BUG#2447).

    - Fixed failover always going to last host in list (BUG#2578)

    - Added 'useUnbufferedInput' parameter, and now use it by default
      (due to JVM issue 
      http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4401235.html)

    - Detect 'on/off' or '1','2','3' form of lower_case_table_names on 
      server.

    - Return 'java.lang.Integer' for TINYINT and SMALLINT types from
      ResultSetMetaData.getColumnClassName() (fix for BUG#2852).

    - Return 'java.lang.Double' for FLOAT type from ResultSetMetaData.
      getColumnClassName() (fix for BUG#2855).

    - Return '[B' instead of java.lang.Object for BINARY, VARBINARY and 
      LONGVARBINARY types from ResultSetMetaData.getColumnClassName() 
      (JDBC compliance).

    - Issue connection events on all instances created from a 
      ConnectionPoolDataSource.
  
01-13-04 - Version 3.0.10-stable

    - Don't count quoted id's when inside a 'string' in PreparedStatement
      parsing (fix for BUG#1511).
      
    - 'Friendlier' exception message for PacketTooLargeException
       (BUG#1534).
       
    - Backported fix for aliased tables and UpdatableResultSets in 
      checkUpdatability() method from 3.1 branch.
      
    - Fix for ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception when using Statement.setMaxRows()
      (BUG#1695).
      
    - Fixed BUG#1576, dealing with large blobs and split packets not being 
      read correctly.
      
    - Fixed regression of Statement.getGeneratedKeys() and REPLACE statements.
    
    - Fixed BUG#1630, subsequent call to ResultSet.updateFoo() causes NPE if
      result set is not updatable.
      
    - Fix for 4.1.1-style auth with no password.
    
    - Fix for BUG#1731, Foreign Keys column sequence is not consistent in
      DatabaseMetaData.getImported/Exported/CrossReference().
      
    - Fix for BUG#1775 - DatabaseMetaData.getSystemFunction() returning 
      bad function 'VResultsSion'.
      
    - Fix for BUG#1592 -- cross-database updatable result sets
      are not checked for updatability correctly.
      
    - DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() should return Types.LONGVARCHAR for
      MySQL LONGTEXT type.
      
    - ResultSet.getObject() on TINYINT and SMALLINT columns should return 
      Java type 'Integer' (BUG#1913)
      
    - Added 'alwaysClearStream' connection property, which causes the driver
      to always empty any remaining data on the input stream before
      each query.
      
    - Added more descriptive error message 'Server Configuration Denies 
      Access to DataSource', as well as retrieval of message from server.
      
    - Autoreconnect code didn't set catalog upon reconnect if it had been 
      changed.
      
    - Implement ResultSet.updateClob().
    
    - ResultSetMetaData.isCaseSensitive() returned wrong value for CHAR/VARCHAR
      columns.
      
    - Fix for BUG#1933 -- Connection property "maxRows" not honored.
    
    - Fix for BUG#1925 -- Statements being created too many times in 
      DBMD.extractForeignKeyFromCreateTable().
      
    - Fix for BUG#1914 -- Support escape sequence {fn convert ... }
    
    - Fix for BUG#1958 -- ArrayIndexOutOfBounds when parameter number == 
      number of parameters + 1.
      
    - Fix for BUG#2006 -- ResultSet.findColumn() should use first matching
      column name when there are duplicate column names in SELECT query 
      (JDBC-compliance).
      
    - Removed static synchronization bottleneck from 
      PreparedStatement.setTimestamp().
      
    - Removed static synchronization bottleneck from instance factory 
      method of SingleByteCharsetConverter.
      
    - Enable caching of the parsing stage of prepared statements via 
      the 'cachePrepStmts', 'prepStmtCacheSize' and 'prepStmtCacheSqlLimit'
      properties (disabled by default).
      
    - Speed up parsing of PreparedStatements, try to use one-pass whenever
      possible.
      
    - Fixed security exception when used in Applets (applets can't
      read the system property 'file.encoding' which is needed
      for LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE).
      
    - Use constants for SQLStates.

    - 'maxRows' property would affect internal statements, so check it for all 
      statement creation internal to the driver, and set to 0 when it is not.
    
10-07-03 - Version 3.0.9-stable

    - Faster date handling code in ResultSet and PreparedStatement (no longer
      uses Date methods that synchronize on static calendars).
    
    - Fixed test for end of buffer in Buffer.readString().

    - Fixed ResultSet.previous() behavior to move current 
      position to before result set when on first row
      of result set (bugs.mysql.com BUG#496)

    - Fixed Statement and PreparedStatement issuing bogus queries
      when setMaxRows() had been used and a LIMIT clause was present
      in the query.

    - Fixed BUG#661 - refreshRow didn't work when primary key values
      contained values that needed to be escaped (they ended up being
      doubly-escaped).

    - Support InnoDB contraint names when extracting foreign key info
      in DatabaseMetaData BUG#517 and BUG#664
      (impl. ideas from Parwinder Sekhon)

    - Backported 4.1 protocol changes from 3.1 branch (server-side SQL
      states, new field info, larger client capability flags, 
      connect-with-database, etc).

    - Fix UpdatableResultSet to return values for getXXX() when on
      insert row (BUG#675).

    - The insertRow in an UpdatableResultSet is now loaded with 
      the default column values when moveToInsertRow() is called
      (BUG#688)

    - DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() wasn't returning NULL for 
      default values that are specified as NULL.

    - Change default statement type/concurrency to TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
      and CONCUR_READ_ONLY (spec compliance).

    - Don't try and reset isolation level on reconnect if MySQL doesn't
      support them.

    - Don't wrap SQLExceptions in RowDataDynamic.

    - Don't change timestamp TZ twice if useTimezone==true (BUG#774)

    - Fixed regression in large split-packet handling (BUG#848).

    - Better diagnostic error messages in exceptions for 'streaming'
      result sets.

    - Issue exception on ResultSet.getXXX() on empty result set (wasn't
      caught in some cases).

    - Don't hide messages from exceptions thrown in I/O layers.

    - Don't fire connection closed events when closing pooled connections, or
      on PooledConnection.getConnection() with already open connections (BUG#884).

    - Clip +/- INF (to smallest and largest representative values for the type in 
      MySQL) and NaN (to 0) for setDouble/setFloat(), and issue a warning on the
      statement when the server does not support +/- INF or NaN.
  
    - Fix for BUG#879, double-escaping of '\' when charset is SJIS or GBK and '\'
      appears in non-escaped input.
  
    - When emptying input stream of unused rows for 'streaming' result sets,
      have the current thread yield() every 100 rows in order to not monopolize 
      CPU time.
  
    - Fixed BUG#1099, DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() getting confused about the
      keyword 'set' in character columns.
  
    - Fixed deadlock issue with Statement.setMaxRows().

    - Fixed CLOB.truncate(), BUG#1130

    - Optimized CLOB.setChracterStream(), BUG#1131

    - Made databaseName, portNumber and serverName optional parameters
      for MysqlDataSourceFactory (BUG#1246)
  
    - Fix for BUG#1247 -- ResultSet.get/setString mashing char 127

    - Backported auth. changes for 4.1.1 and newer from 3.1 branch. 

    - Added com.mysql.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport to help creation of testcases
      for bug reports.
  
    - Added property to 'clobber' streaming results, by setting the 
      'clobberStreamingResults' property to 'true' (the default is 'false'). 
      This will cause a 'streaming' ResultSet to be automatically
      closed, and any oustanding data still streaming from the server to
      be discarded if another query is executed before all the data has been
      read from the server.

      setClob().
      
    - 4.1 Column Metadata fixes
    
    - Remove synchronization from Driver.connect() and 
      Driver.acceptsUrl().
      
    - IOExceptions during a transaction now cause the Connection to 
      be closed.
      
    - Fixed missing conversion for 'YEAR' type in ResultSetMetaData.
      getColumnTypeName().
      
    - Don't pick up indexes that start with 'pri' as primary keys
      for DBMD.getPrimaryKeys().
      
    - Throw SQLExceptions when trying to do operations on a forcefully
      closed Connection (i.e. when a communication link failure occurs).
      
    - You can now toggle profiling on/off using 
      Connection.setProfileSql(boolean).

    - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.isWritable() to return correct value.
    
    - Add 'window' of different NULL sorting behavior to 
      DBMD.nullsAreSortedAtStart (4.0.2 to 4.0.10, true, otherwise,
      no).
      
    - Implemented Blob.setBytes(). You still need to pass the 
      resultant Blob back into an updatable ResultSet or
      PreparedStatement to persist the changes, as MySQL does
      not support 'locators'.
      
    - Backported 4.1 charset field info changes from Connector/J 3.1
      
01-22-03 - Version 3.0.5-gamma

      pool).
      
    - Added missing LONGTEXT type to DBMD.getColumns().
    
    - Retrieve TX_ISOLATION from database for 
      Connection.getTransactionIsolation() when the MySQL version 
      supports it, instead of an instance variable.
      
    - Quote table names in DatabaseMetaData.getColumns(),
      getPrimaryKeys(), getIndexInfo(), getBestRowIdentifier()
      
    - Greatly reduce memory required for setBinaryStream() in
      PreparedStatements.
      
    - Fixed ResultSet.isBeforeFirst() for empty result sets.
    
    - Added update options for foreign key metadata.

      outbound packet with MysqlIO.
      
    - Added 'strictUpdates' property to allow control of amount
      of checking for 'correctness' of updatable result sets. Set this
      to 'false' if you want faster updatable result sets and you know
      that you create them from SELECTs on tables with primary keys and
      that you have selected all primary keys in your query.
      
    - Added support for 4.0.8-style large packets. 
    
    - Fixed PreparedStatement.executeBatch() parameter overwriting.
  
12-17-02 - Version 3.0.3-dev

      converter.
      
    - Fixed charset handling in Fields.java
    
    - Implemented Connection.nativeSQL()
    
    - More robust escape tokenizer -- recognize '--' comments, and allow
      nested escape sequences (see testsuite.EscapeProcessingTest)
      
    - DBMD.getImported/ExportedKeys() now handles multiple foreign keys 
      per table.
      
    - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision() returning incorrect values 
      for some floating point types.
      
    - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getColumnTypeName() returning BLOB for 
      TEXT and TEXT for BLOB types.
      
    - Fixed Buffer.isLastDataPacket() for 4.1 and newer servers.
    
    - Added CLIENT_LONG_FLAG to be able to get more column flags 
      (isAutoIncrement() being the most important)
      
    - Because of above, implemented ResultSetMetaData.isAutoIncrement()
      to use Field.isAutoIncrement().
      
    - Honor 'lower_case_table_names' when enabled in the server when
      doing table name comparisons in DatabaseMetaData methods.
      
    - Some MySQL-4.1 protocol support (extended field info from selects)
    
    - Use non-aliased table/column names and database names to fullly 
      qualify tables and columns in UpdatableResultSet (requires 
      MySQL-4.1 or newer)
      
    - Allow user to alter behavior of Statement/
      PreparedStatement.executeBatch() via 'continueBatchOnError' property
      (defaults to 'true').
      
    - Check for connection closed in more Connection methods 
      (createStatement, prepareStatement, setTransactionIsolation,
      setAutoCommit).
      
    - More robust implementation of updatable result sets. Checks that
      _all_ primary keys of the table have been selected.
      
    - 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ...' now works, if your server is configured
      to allow it. Can be turned off with the 'allowLoadLocalInfile' 
      property (see the README).
      
    - Substitute '?' for unknown character conversions in single-byte
      character sets instead of '\0'.
      
    - NamedPipeSocketFactory now works (only intended for Windows), see
      README for instructions.

    - Fixed incorrect conversion in ResultSet.getLong()
    
    - Implemented ResultSet.updateBlob().
    
    - Removed duplicate code from UpdatableResultSet (it can be inherited 
      from ResultSet, the extra code for each method to handle updatability
      I thought might someday be necessary has not been needed).
      
    - Fixed "UnsupportedEncodingException" thrown when "forcing" a 
      character encoding via properties.
      
    - Fixed various non-ASCII character encoding issues.
    
    - Added driver property 'useHostsInPrivileges'. Defaults to true. 
      Affects whether or not '@hostname' will be used in 
      DBMD.getColumn/TablePrivileges.
      
    - All DBMD result set columns describing schemas now return NULL
      to be more compliant with the behavior of other JDBC drivers
      for other databases (MySQL does not support schemas).
      
    - Added SSL support. See README for information on how to use it.
    
    - Properly restore connection properties when autoReconnecting
      or failing-over, including autoCommit state, and isolation level.
      
    - Use 'SHOW CREATE TABLE' when possible for determining foreign key
      information for DatabaseMetaData...also allows cascade options for
      DELETE information to be returned
      
    - Escape 0x5c character in strings for the SJIS charset.
    
    - Fixed start position off-by-1 error in Clob.getSubString()

      'shutdown' command to MySQL server...Intended to be used when 'embedding'
      Java and MySQL server together in an end-user application.
      
    - Added 'connectTimeout' parameter that allows users of JDK-1.4 and newer
      to specify a maxium time to wait to establish a connection.
      
    - Failover and autoReconnect only work when the connection is in a 
      autoCommit(false) state, in order to stay transaction safe
      
    - Added 'queriesBeforeRetryMaster' property that specifies how many
      queries to issue when failed over before attempting to reconnect 
      to the master (defaults to 50)
      
    - Fixed DBMD.supportsResultSetConcurrency() so that it returns true
      for ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY or
      ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
      
    - Fixed ResultSet.isLast() for empty result sets (should return false).
    
    - PreparedStatement now honors stream lengths in setBinary/Ascii/Character
      Stream() unless you set the connection property 
      'useStreamLengthsInPrepStmts' to 'false'.
      
    - Removed some not-needed temporary object creation by using Strings
      smarter in EscapeProcessor, Connection and DatabaseMetaData classes.

09-21-02 - Version 3.0.1-dev

    - Fixed ResultSet.getRow() off-by-one bug.
    
    - Fixed RowDataStatic.getAt() off-by-one bug.
    
    - Added limited Clob functionality (ResultSet.getClob(),
      PreparedStatemtent.setClob(), 
      PreparedStatement.setObject(Clob).
      
    - Added socketTimeout parameter to URL.
    
    - Connection.isClosed() no longer "pings" the server.
    
    - Connection.close() issues rollback() when getAutoCommit() == false
    
    - Added "paranoid" parameter...sanitizes error messages removing
      "sensitive" information from them (i.e. hostnames, ports,
      usernames, etc.), as well as clearing "sensitive" data structures
      when possible.
      
    - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.isSigned() for TINYINT and BIGINT.
    
    - Charsets now automatically detected. Optimized code for single-byte
      character set conversion.

      non-GPL licenses, please contact me &lt;mark@mysql.com&gt;
      
    - JDBC-3.0 functionality including 
      Statement/PreparedStatement.getGeneratedKeys() and
      ResultSet.getURL()

    - More code cleanup
    
    - PreparedStatement now releases resources on .close() (SF bug 553268)
    
    - Quoted identifiers not used if server version does not support them. Also,
      if server started with --ansi or --sql-mode=ANSI_QUOTES then '"' will be

    - ResultSet.getDouble() now uses code built into JDK to be more precise (but slower)
    
    - LogicalHandle.isClosed() calls through to physical connection
    
    - Added SQL profiling (to STDERR). Set "profileSql=true" in your JDBC url.

    - ResultSetMetaData.getColumnClassName() now implemented
    
    - Rudimentary version of Statement.getGeneratedKeys() from JDBC-3.0
      now implemented (you need to be using JDK-1.4 for this to work, I
      believe)
  
    - DBMetaData.getIndexInfo() - bad PAGES fixed (SF BUG 542201)

04-07-02 - Version 2.0.12

    - General code cleanup. 
    
    - Added getIdleFor() method to Connection and MysqlLogicalHandle.
    
    - Relaxed synchronization in all classes, should fix 520615 and 520393.
    
    - Added getTable/ColumnPrivileges() to DBMD (fixes 484502).

      that need them (should fix 518108)
      
    - Added support for YEAR type (533556)
    
    - ResultSet.insertRow() should now detect auto_increment fields
      in most cases and use that value in the new row. This detection
      will not work in multi-valued keys, however, due to the fact that
      the MySQL protocol does not return this information.
      
    - ResultSet.refreshRow() implemented.
    
    - Fixed testsuite.Traversal afterLast() bug, thanks to Igor Lastric.

01-27-02 - Version 2.0.11

    - Fixed missing DELETE_RULE value in 
      DBMD.getImported/ExportedKeys() and getCrossReference().
      
    - Full synchronization of Statement.java.
    
    - More changes to fix "Unexpected end of input stream"

       (bug 488663).
       
     - Implementation of DatabaseMetaData.getExported/ImportedKeys() and
       getCrossReference().
       
     - Full synchronization on methods modifying instance and class-shared
       references, driver should be entirely thread-safe now (please
       let me know if you have problems)
       
     - DataSource implementations moved to org.gjt.mm.mysql.jdbc2.optional
       package, and (initial) implementations of PooledConnectionDataSource
       and XADataSource are in place (thanks to Todd Wolff for the 
       implementation and testing of PooledConnectionDataSource with 
       IBM WebSphere 4).

       (bug 491577).
       
     - Removed concatenation support from driver (the '||' operator),
       as older versions of VisualAge seem to be the only thing that
       use it, and it conflicts with the logical '||' operator. You will
       need to start mysqld with the "--ansi" flag to use the '||' 
       operator as concatenation (bug 491680)
       
     - Fixed casting bug in PreparedStatement (bug 488663).
     
11-25-01 - Version 2.0.8

     - Batch updates now supported (thanks to some inspiration 
       from Daniel Rall).
       
     - XADataSource/ConnectionPoolDataSource code (experimental)
     
     - PreparedStatement.setAnyNumericType() now handles positive
       exponents correctly (adds "+" so MySQL can understand it).
       
     - DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() and getBestRowIdentifier()
       are now more robust in identifying primary keys (matches 
       regardless of case or abbreviation/full spelling of Primary Key
       in Key_type column).
       
10-24-01 - Version 2.0.7

     - PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream() now implemented
         
     - Fixed dangling socket problem when in high availability
       (autoReconnect=true) mode, and finalizer for Connection will
       close any dangling sockets on GC.
       
     - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision() returning one
       less than actual on newer versions of MySQL.
       
     - ResultSet.getBlob() now returns null if column value
       was null.
       
     - Character sets read from database if useUnicode=true
       and characterEncoding is not set. (thanks to 
       Dmitry Vereshchagin)
       
     - Initial transaction isolation level read from 
       database (if avaialable) (thanks to Dmitry Vereshchagin)
       
     - Fixed DatabaseMetaData.supportsTransactions(), and
       supportsTransactionIsolationLevel() and getTypeInfo()
       SQL_DATETIME_SUB and SQL_DATA_TYPE fields not being
       readable.
        
     - Fixed PreparedStatement generating SQL that would end
       up with syntax errors for some queries.
       
     - Fixed ResultSet.isAfterLast() always returning false.
         
     - Fixed timezone issue in PreparedStatement.setTimestamp()
       (thanks to Erik Olofsson)
         
     - Captialize type names when "captializeTypeNames=true"
       is passed in URL or properties (for WebObjects, thanks
       to Anjo Krank)
         
     - Updatable result sets now correctly handle NULL
       values in fields.
       
     - PreparedStatement.setDouble() now uses full-precision
       doubles (reverting a fix made earlier to truncate them).
       
     - PreparedStatement.setBoolean() will use 1/0 for values
       if your MySQL Version &gt;= 3.21.23.

06-16-01 - Version 2.0.6

     - Fixed PreparedStatement parameter checking

     - Implemented getBigDecimal() without scale component
       for JDBC2.

     - Fixed composite key problem with updateable result sets.

     - Added detection of -/+INF for doubles.

     - Faster ASCII string operations.

     - Fixed incorrect detection of MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET, so sending
       large blobs should work now.

     - Fixed off-by-one error in java.sql.Blob implementation code.

     - Added "ultraDevHack" URL parameter, set to "true" to allow 
       (broken) Macromedia UltraDev to use the driver.

04-06-00 - Version 2.0.1

     - Fixed RSMD.isWritable() returning wrong value. 
       Thanks to Moritz Maass.

     - Cleaned up exception handling when driver connects

     - Columns that are of type TEXT now return as Strings
       when you use getObject()

     - DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() now works correctly wrt

     - No escape processing is done on PreparedStatements anymore
       per JDBC spec.

     - Fixed many JDBC-2.0 traversal, positioning bugs, especially
       wrt to empty result sets. Thanks to Ron Smits, Nick Brook,
       Cessar Garcia and Carlos Martinez.

     - Fixed some issues with updatability support in ResultSet when
       using multiple primary keys.

02-21-00 - Version 2.0pre5

     - Fixed Bad Handshake problem.

01-10-00 - Version 2.0pre4

     - Fixes to ResultSet for insertRow() - Thanks to
       Cesar Garcia

     - Fix to Driver to recognize JDBC-2.0 by loading a JDBC-2.0
       class, instead of relying on JDK version numbers. Thanks
       to John Baker.

     - Fixed ResultSet to return correct row numbers
     
     - Statement.getUpdateCount() now returns rows matched,
       instead of rows actually updated, which is more SQL-92
       like.

10-29-99 

     - Statement/PreparedStatement.getMoreResults() bug fixed. 
       Thanks to Noel J. Bergman.

     - Added Short as a type to PreparedStatement.setObject().
       Thanks to Jeff Crowder

     - Driver now automagically configures maximum/preferred packet
       sizes by querying server.

     - Autoreconnect code uses fast ping command if server supports
       it.

     - Fixed various bugs wrt. to packet sizing when reading from
       the server and when alloc'ing to write to the server.

08-17-99 - Version 2.0pre

     - Now compiles under JDK-1.2. The driver supports both JDK-1.1
       and JDK-1.2 at the same time through a core set of classes.
       The driver will load the appropriate interface classes at
       runtime by figuring out which JVM version you are using.

     - Fixes for result sets with all nulls in the first row.
       (Pointed out by Tim Endres)

     - Fixes to column numbers in SQLExceptions in ResultSet
       (Thanks to Blas Rodriguez Somoza)

     - The database no longer needs to specified to connect.
       (Thanks to Christian Motschke)

07-04-99 - Version 1.2b

     - Better Documentation (in progress), in doc/mm.doc/book1.html

     - DBMD now allows null for a column name pattern (not in 
       spec), which it changes to '%'.

     - DBMD now has correct types/lengths for getXXX().

     - ResultSet.getDate(), getTime(), and getTimestamp() fixes. 
       (contributed by Alan Wilken)

     - EscapeProcessor now handles \{ \} and { or } inside quotes
       correctly. (thanks to Alik for some ideas on how to fix it)

     - Fixes to properties handling in Connection.
       (contributed by Juho Tikkala)

     - ResultSet.getObject() now returns null for NULL columns
       in the table, rather than bombing out.
       (thanks to Ben Grosman)

     - ResultSet.getObject() now returns Strings for types
       from MySQL that it doesn't know about. (Suggested by
       Chris Perdue)

     - Removed DataInput/Output streams, not needed, 1/2 number
       of method calls per IO operation.

     - Use default character encoding if one is not specified. This
       is a work-around for broken JVMs, because according to spec,
       EVERY JVM must support "ISO8859_1", but they don't.

     - Fixed Connection to use the platform character encoding
       instead of "ISO8859_1" if one isn't explicitly set. This 
       fixes problems people were having loading the character-
       converter classes that didn't always exist (JVM bug).
       (thanks to Fritz Elfert for pointing out this problem)

     - Changed MysqlIO to re-use packets where possible to reduce
       memory usage.

     - Fixed escape-processor bugs pertaining to {} inside
       quotes.

04-14-99 - Version 1.2a

     - Fixed character-set support for non-Javasoft JVMs
       (thanks to many people for pointing it out)

     - Fixed ResultSet.getBoolean() to recognize 'y' &amp; 'n'
       as well as '1' &amp; '0' as boolean flags.
       (thanks to Tim Pizey)

     - Fixed ResultSet.getTimestamp() to give better performance.
       (thanks to Richard Swift)

     - Fixed getByte() for numeric types.
       (thanks to Ray Bellis)

     - Fixed DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo() for DATE type.
       (thanks to Paul Johnston)

     - Fixed EscapeProcessor for "fn" calls.
       (thanks to Piyush Shah at locomotive.org)

     - Fixed EscapeProcessor to not do extraneous work if there
       are no escape codes.
       (thanks to Ryan Gustafson)

     - Fixed Driver to parse URLs of the form "jdbc:mysql://host:port"
       (thanks to Richard Lobb)

03-24-99 - Version 1.1i

     - Fixed Timestamps for PreparedStatements
    
     - Fixed null pointer exceptions in RSMD and RS

     - Re-compiled with jikes for valid class files (thanks ms!)

03-08-99 - Version 1.1h

     - Fixed escape processor to deal with un-matched { and }
       (thanks to Craig Coles)
       
     - Fixed escape processor to create more portable (between
       DATETIME and TIMESTAMP types) representations so that
       it will work with BETWEEN clauses.
       (thanks to Craig Longman)
       
     - MysqlIO.quit() now closes the socket connection. Before,
       after many failed connections some OS's would run out
       of file descriptors. (thanks to Michael Brinkman)
       
     - Fixed NullPointerException in Driver.getPropertyInfo.
       (thanks to Dave Potts)
        
     - Fixes to MysqlDefs to allow all *text fields to be
       retrieved as Strings.
       (thanks to Chris at Leverage)
       
     - Fixed setDouble in PreparedStatement for large numbers
       to avoid sending scientific notation to the database.
       (thanks to J.S. Ferguson)
       
     - Fixed getScale() and getPrecision() in RSMD.
       (contrib'd by James Klicman)
       
     - Fixed getObject() when field was DECIMAL or NUMERIC
       (thanks to Bert Hobbs)
       
     - DBMD.getTables() bombed when passed a null table-name
       pattern. Fixed. (thanks to Richard Lobb)
       
     - Added check for "client not authorized" errors during
       connect. (thanks to Hannes Wallnoefer)
       
02-19-99 - Version 1.1g

     - Result set rows are now byte arrays. Blobs and Unicode
       work bidriectonally now. The useUnicode and encoding
       options are implemented now.
       
     - Fixes to PreparedStatement to send binary set by
       setXXXStream to be sent un-touched to the MySQL server.
       
     - Fixes to getDriverPropertyInfo().
       
12-31-98 - Version 1.1f

     - Changed all ResultSet fields to Strings, this should allow
       Unicode to work, but your JVM must be able to convert
       between the character sets. This should also make reading
       data from the server be a bit quicker, because there is now
       no conversion from StringBuffer to String.

     - Changed PreparedStatement.streamToString() to be more
       efficient (code from Uwe Schaefer).

     - URL parsing is more robust (throws SQL exceptions on errors
       rather than NullPointerExceptions)

     - PreparedStatement now can convert Strings to Time/Date values
       via setObject() (code from Robert Currey).

     - IO no longer hangs in Buffer.readInt(), that bug was
       introduced in 1.1d when changing to all byte-arrays for
       result sets. (Pointed out by Samo Login)

11-03-98 - Version 1.1b 

     - Fixes to DatabaseMetaData to allow both IBM VA and J-Builder
       to work. Let me know how it goes. (thanks to Jac Kersing)

     - Fix to ResultSet.getBoolean() for NULL strings 
       (thanks to Barry Lagerweij)

     - Beginning of code cleanup, and formatting. Getting ready
       to branch this off to a parallel JDBC-2.0 source tree.

     - Added "final" modifier to critical sections in MysqlIO and
       Buffer to allow compiler to inline methods for speed.

9-29-98 

     - If object references passed to setXXX() in PreparedStatement are
       null, setNull() is automatically called for you. (Thanks for the
       suggestion goes to Erik Ostrom)

     - setObject() in PreparedStatement will now attempt to write a 
       serialized  representation of the object to the database for
       objects of Types.OTHER and objects of unknown type.

     - Util now has a static method readObject() which given a ResultSet
       and a column index will re-instantiate an object serialized in
       the above manner.

9-02-98 - Vesion 1.1

     - Got rid of "ugly hack" in MysqlIO.nextRow(). Rather than
       catch an exception, Buffer.isLastDataPacket() was fixed.
          
     - Connection.getCatalog() and Connection.setCatalog()
       should work now.

     - Statement.setMaxRows() works, as well as setting
       by property maxRows. Statement.setMaxRows() overrides
       maxRows set via properties or url parameters.

     - Automatic re-connection is available. Because it has
       to "ping" the database before each query, it is
       turned off by default. To use it, pass in "autoReconnect=true"
       in the connection URL. You may also change the number of
       reconnect tries, and the initial timeout value via 
       "maxReconnects=n" (default 3) and "initialTimeout=n" 
       (seconds, default 2) parameters. The timeout is an 
       exponential backoff type of timeout, e.g. if you have initial 
       timeout of 2 seconds, and maxReconnects of 3, then the driver
       will timeout 2 seconds, 4 seconds, then 16 seconds between each
       re-connection attempt.

8-24-98 - Version 1.0 

     - Fixed handling of blob data in Buffer.java

     - Fixed bug with authentication packet being
       sized too small.

     - The JDBC Driver is now under the LPGL

8-14-98 - 

     - Fixed Buffer.readLenString() to correctly
          read data for BLOBS.
          
     - Fixed PreparedStatement.stringToStream to
          correctly read data for BLOBS.
          
     - Fixed PreparedStatement.setDate() to not
       add a day.
       (above fixes thanks to Vincent Partington)
          
     - Added URL parameter parsing (?user=... etc).
      

8-04-98 - Version 0.9d

     - Big news! New package name. Tim Endres from ICE
       Engineering is starting a new source tree for
       GNU GPL'd Java software. He's graciously given
       me the org.gjt.mm package directory to use, so now 
       the driver is in the org.gjt.mm.mysql package scheme.
       I'm "legal" now. Look for more information on Tim's
       project soon.
          
     - Now using dynamically sized packets to reduce
       memory usage when sending commands to the DB.
          
     - Small fixes to getTypeInfo() for parameters, etc.
          
     - DatabaseMetaData is now fully implemented. Let me
       know if these drivers work with the various IDEs
       out there. I've heard that they're working with
       JBuilder right now.
          
     - Added JavaDoc documentation to the package.
          
     - Package now available in .zip or .tar.gz.
          
7-28-98 - Version 0.9

     - Implemented getTypeInfo(). 
       Connection.rollback() now throws an SQLException
       per the JDBC spec.
          
     - Added PreparedStatement that supports all JDBC API
       methods for PreparedStatement including InputStreams.
       Please check this out and let me know if anything is
       broken.
          
     - Fixed a bug in ResultSet that would break some
       queries that only returned 1 row.
          
     - Fixed bugs in DatabaseMetaData.getTables(), 
       DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() and
       DatabaseMetaData.getCatalogs().
          
     - Added functionality to Statement that allows
       executeUpdate() to store values for IDs that are
       automatically generated for AUTO_INCREMENT fields.
       Basically, after an executeUpdate(), look at the
       SQLWarnings for warnings like "LAST_INSERTED_ID =
       'some number', COMMAND = 'your SQL query'".
          
       If you are using AUTO_INCREMENT fields in your
       tables and are executing a lot of executeUpdate()s
       on one Statement, be sure to clearWarnings() every
       so often to save memory.

7-06-98 - Version 0.8

     - Split MysqlIO and Buffer to separate classes. Some
       ClassLoaders gave an IllegalAccess error for some
       fields in those two classes. Now mm.mysql works in 
       applets and all classloaders.

       Thanks to Joe Ennis &lt;jce@mail.boone.com&gt; for pointing
       out the problem and working on a fix with me.

7-01-98 - Version 0.7

     - Fixed DatabaseMetadata problems in getColumns() and
       bug in switch statement in the Field constructor.

       Thanks to Costin Manolache &lt;costin@tdiinc.com&gt; for 
       pointing these out.

5-21-98 - Version 0.6

     - Incorporated efficiency changes from 
       Richard Swift &lt;Richard.Swift@kanatek.ca&gt; in
       MysqlIO.java and ResultSet.java

     - We're now 15% faster than gwe's driver.

     - Started working on DatabaseMetaData.
          
       The following methods are implemented:
        * getTables() 
        * getTableTypes()
        * getColumns
        * getCatalogs()
