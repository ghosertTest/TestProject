	 * Reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of
	 * bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller
	 * number may be read, possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is
	 * returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available,
	 * end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.
	 * 
	 * If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown.
	 * 
	 * If off is negative, or len is negative, or off+len is greater than the
	 * length of the array b, then an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
	 * 
	 * If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise,
	 * there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available
	 * because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned;
	 * otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b.
	 * 
	 * The first byte read is stored into element b[off], the next one into
	 * b[off+1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to len.
	 * Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
	 * elements b[off] through b[off+k-1], leaving elements b[off+k] through
	 * b[off+len-1] unaffected.
	 * 
	 * In every case, elements b[0] through b[off] and elements b[off+len]
	 * through b[b.length-1] are unaffected.
	 * 
	 * If the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than end of file,
	 * then an IOException is thrown. In particular, an IOException is thrown if
	 * the input stream has been closed.
	 * 
	 * The read(b, off, len) method for class InputStream simply calls the
	 * method read() repeatedly. If the first such call results in an
	 * IOException, that exception is returned from the call to the read(b, off,
	 * len) method. If any subsequent call to read() results in a IOException,
	 * the exception is caught and treated as if it were end of file; the bytes
	 * read up to that point are stored into b and the number of bytes read
	 * before the exception occurred is returned. Subclasses are encouraged to
	 * provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
	 * 
	 * Parameters: b - the buffer into which the data is read. off - the start
	 * offset in array b at which the data is written. len - the maximum number
	 * of bytes to read. Returns: the total number of bytes read into the
	 * buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has
	 * been reached. Throws: IOException - if an I/O error occurs. See Also:
	 * read()
