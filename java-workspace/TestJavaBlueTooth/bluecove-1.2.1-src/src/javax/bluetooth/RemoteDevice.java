	 * Attempts to turn encryption on or off for an existing connection. In the
	 * case where the parameter on is true, this method will first authenticate
	 * this RemoteDevice if it has not already been authenticated. Then it will
	 * attempt to turn on encryption. If the connection is already encrypted
	 * then this method returns true. Otherwise, when the parameter on is true,
	 * either: the method succeeds in turning on encryption for the connection
	 * and returns true, or the method was unsuccessful in turning on encryption
	 * and returns false. This could happen because the stack does not support
	 * encryption or because encryption conflicts with the user's security
	 * settings for the device. In the case where the parameter on is false,
	 * there are again two possible outcomes:
	 * 
	 * encryption is turned off on the connection and true is returned, or
	 * encryption is left on for the connection and false is returned.
	 * Encryption may be left on following encrypt(conn, false) for a variety of
	 * reasons. The user's current security settings for the device may require
	 * encryption or the stack may not have a mechanism to turn off encryption.
	 * Also, the BCC may have determined that encryption will be kept on for the
	 * physical link to this RemoteDevice. The details of the BCC are
	 * implementation dependent, but encryption might be left on because other
	 * connections to the same device need encryption. (All of the connections
	 * over the same physical link must be encrypted if any of them are
	 * encrypted.) While attempting to turn encryption off may not succeed
	 * immediately because other connections need encryption on, there may be a
	 * delayed effect. At some point, all of the connections over this physical
	 * link needing encryption could be closed or also have had the method
	 * encrypt(conn, false) invoked for them. In this case, the BCC may turn off
	 * encryption for all connections over this physical link. (The policy used
	 * by the BCC is implementation dependent.) It is recommended that
	 * applications do encrypt(conn, false) once they no longer need encryption
	 * to allow the BCC to determine if it can reduce the overhead on
	 * connections to this RemoteDevice.
	 * 
	 * The fact that encrypt(conn, false) may not succeed in turning off
	 * encryption has very few consequences for applications. The stack handles
	 * encryption and decryption, so the application does not have to do
	 * anything different depending on whether the connection is still encrypted
	 * or not.
