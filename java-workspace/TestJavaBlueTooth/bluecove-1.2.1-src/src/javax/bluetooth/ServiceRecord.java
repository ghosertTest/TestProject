	 * Used by a server application to indicate the major service class bits
	 * that should be activated in the server's DeviceClass when this
	 * ServiceRecord is added to the SDDB. When client devices do device
	 * discovery, the server's DeviceClass is provided as one of the arguments
	 * of the deviceDiscovered method of the DiscoveryListener interface. Client
	 * devices can consult the DeviceClass of the server device to get a general
	 * idea of the kind of device this is (e.g., phone, PDA, or PC) and the
	 * major service classes it offers (e.g., rendering, telephony, or
	 * information). A server application should use the setDeviceServiceClasses
	 * method to describe its service in terms of the major service classes.
	 * This allows clients to obtain a DeviceClass for the server that
	 * accurately describes all of the services being offered. When
	 * acceptAndOpen() is invoked for the first time on the notifier associated
	 * with this ServiceRecord, the classes argument from the
	 * setDeviceServiceClasses method is OR'ed with the current setting of the
	 * major service class bits of the local device. The OR operation
	 * potentially activates additional bits. These bits may be retrieved by
	 * calling getDeviceClass() on the LocalDevice object. Likewise, a call to
	 * LocalDevice.updateRecord() will cause the major service class bits to be
	 * OR'ed with the current settings and updated.
	 * 
	 * The documentation for DeviceClass gives examples of the integers that
	 * describe each of the major service classes and provides a URL for the
	 * complete list. These integers can be used individually or OR'ed together
	 * to describe the appropriate value for classes.
	 * 
	 * Later, when this ServiceRecord is removed from the SDDB, the
	 * implementation will automatically deactivate the device bits that were
	 * activated as a result of the call to setDeviceServiceClasses. The only
	 * exception to this occurs if there is another ServiceRecord that is in the
	 * SDDB and setDeviceServiceClasses has been sent to that other
	 * ServiceRecord to request that some of the same bits be activated.
	 * 
	 * Parameters: classes - an integer whose binary representation indicates
	 * the major service class bits that should be activated Throws:
	 * IllegalArgumentException - if classes is not an OR of one or more of the
	 * major service class integers in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers document.
	 * While Limited Discoverable Mode is included in this list of major service
	 * classes, its bit is activated by placing the device in Limited
	 * Discoverable Mode (see the GAP specification), so if bit 13 is set this
	 * exception will be thrown. RuntimeExceptin - if the ServiceRecord
	 * receiving the message was obtained from a remote device
